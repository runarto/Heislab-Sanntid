Elevator driver for Go
======================

In order to run, first connect to the elevatorserver by typing ´elevatorserver´ in the terminal. Then, type ´go run .´ in another terminal. If you are running from the simulator, you can do ´./SimElevatorServer --port=xxxx´, followed by ´go run . -port=xxxx´ in order to connect multiple elevators to the same network through the simulator.
