Elevator driver for Go
======================

In order to run, first connect to the elevatorserver by typing ´elevatorserver´ in the terminal. Then, type ´go run main.go -id=x´ in another terminal. Make sure you use IDs in the range of 0-2.

If you are running from the simulator, you can do ´./SimElevatorServer --port=xxxx´, followed by ´go run main.go -port=xxxx -id=x´ in order to connect multiple elevators to the same network through the simulator.
